# webPiano

(c) 2020 Jürgen Wothke


This toy project is the result of my first exploration into the realm of synthesized
piano sounds. My goal was to get some hands on experience with a respective "digital waveguide"
based design and to learn a thing or two in the process.

The implementation is based Balázs Bank's "Physics-Based Sound Synthesis of the Piano"
(see http://home.mit.bme.hu/~bank/thesis/pianomod.pdf) and the various papers that are cross
referenced in that thesis (see respective references in the code comments).
